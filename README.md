## Simple minesweeper project made in C language
### This was made in collaboration with my classmate Orestis Zappas

Features a playable minesweeper game with functions such as:

- Difficulty select (Easy,Medium,Hard)
- Level select (NxN format)
- Marking and unmarking a square with a flag as unsafe
- Cheating to see behind a square without the risk of loosing (limited to 3 tries)
- If the current level is won then the user will automaticaly be taken to the next level and so on untill he finaly wins

These functions make the game well playable and fun!
